    <div class="contentInfo">
      <p>When we are young, we never worry about our health or quality of life. But as I've gotten older, I've realized how important that is from my own experience and from working with older personal training clients. My senior clients have taught me about the importance of being healthy and taking care of our bodies for the future. Even more important, they've taught me that it's never too late to start exercising.</p><br>

      <h3>You Can Stop the Clock</h3>
        <p>Despite all the anti-aging products pushed on us, it's inevitable that we will get older.<br> 
        <p class="inset"><strong>Some of the things we lose as we age can actually be prevented, including:</strong><br>
        <strong>* Strength and Muscle: </strong>Sarcopenia is the fancy term scientists have given to describe loss of muscle, strength and quality of tissue often seen in older adults. Some experts have suggested that muscle mass declines about 1 percent each year from age 30.<br>
        <strong>* Cardio Endurance:</strong> As we age, we often lose aerobic fitness and experts believe this contributes to reduced mobility in daily life.<br>
        <strong>* Flexibility:</strong> Joints change with age and this can lead to stiffness, decreased range of motion and more injuries.<br>
        <strong>* Balance:</strong> Each year, hospitals see thousands of older patients for broken hips due to falling. Balance exercises can help you avoid injuries from falls and keep you independent and mobile.<br>
        </p>
        The good news is that the loss of strength, endurance, flexibility and balance aren't inevitable. The National Institute on Aging believes that, "when older people lose their ability to do things on their own, it doesn't happen just because they have aged. More likely it is because they have become inactive." (Exercise: A Guide from the National Institute on Aging)</p><br>

        <h3>It's Never too Late</h3>
        No matter how old you are, exercise can improve your quality of life and you don't have to spend a lot of time doing it to see and feel improvements. Like everyone else, seniors need to engage in cardio, strength training, and flexibility exercises to stay healthy and maintain as much strength and functionality as possible.<br><br>
        <h3>Strength Training for Seniors</h3>
        Strength training has incredible benefits for everyone, but especially for seniors. Experts believe that resistance exercise may forestall declines in strength and muscle mass for decades.<br>
        Before you get started, it's essential to get checked out by your doctor. If you have any conditions such as arthritis, osteoporosis, high blood pressure or heart disease, you'll need to learn the types of exercises you can and cannot do.<br>
        <p class="inset"><strong>Iâ€™ll use the following guidelines to set up your program:</strong><br>
        * A warm-up with light exercise before lifting weights.<br>
        * All muscle groups (lower body, chest, back, shoulders, biceps, triceps, and abs) will be engaged.<br>
        * I will start you out with no weights or light weights to practice the exercises and condition your body. You will use dumbbells, machines, and/or resistance bands.<br>
        * Do each exercise for at least 1 set of 10-15 repetitions.<br>
        * Progress by adding more sets (with rest in between) and/or increasing the weights each week.<br>
        * The focus will be on having good form for each exercise.<br>
        * A cool-down regiment for afterward.</p>
        If you've never lifted weights before, it is important to work with a personal trainer to learn the proper way to lift. I have a lot of experience working with seniors, even if you have any medical conditions, injuries, or joint problems.<br><br>

        <h3>Cardio Exercise for Seniors</h3>
        Because endurance can decline over the years, it's important to engage in some type of aerobic exercise. The National Institute on Aging recommends seniors shoot for 30 minutes of cardio exercise each day.<br>
        <p class="inset"><strong>To get started:</strong><br>
        * See your doctor first if you have any medical issues.<br>
        * Always warm up with 5 or more minutes of light activity.<br>
        * Choose an activity you enjoy and something that's accessible such as walking, swimming, biking, tennis, etc.<br>
        * If you've never exercised or it's been a while, start with 5-10 minutes of cardio 3 times a week and allow your body time to get used to it. Each week, add a few minutes until you can move continuously for 30 or more minutes.<br>
        * Work at a moderate intensity - you should be able to carry on a conversation.<br>
        * Stretch after your workout.</p><br><br>
        <h3><strong>Flexibility & Balance for Seniors</strong></h3>
        It's important to stay flexible as you get older, so plan on stretching after your workouts or incorporate yoga into your routine. Be sure your muscles are warm when you stretch, either from working out or after getting out of a hot bath or shower. In addition to a basic flexibility workout, be sure to incorporate balance exercises into your day.<br>
        Remember that any activity is better than none, so start with something easy and enjoyable. You'll find that, over time, exercise can help you improve your quality of life and help you age gracefully.
